# MindFi Git Mentors Application

## Problem Statement
 Provide a simple web app using Github users API, that will help a newbie software engineer to find a mentorship from top developers in his field.


## **Acceptance Criteria Check**  

- **See how many mentors are available for browsing.**  
  - When the user opens the **Landing Page**, all available mentors from the GitHub API are displayed in a beautifully responsive grid.  

- **See a list of mentors and their stats.**  
  - On the **Landing Page**, users can view mentor statistics by hovering over the respective **Mentor Card**.  
  - To optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API requests, the mentor stats are fetched **on hover** instead of retrieving details for all mentors at once (Lazy Loading).  

- **View full details of a mentor.**  
  - Users can access a mentor's full details on the **Mentor Detail Page** (`/user/<username>`).  
  - Clicking on a **Mentor Card** navigates the user to this page.  
  - Additionally, a redirect link to the mentor's original **GitHub profile** is provided.  

- **View available slots to talk to a mentor.**  
  - The **available slots** for each mentor are displayed on the **Mentor Detail Page**.  

- **Robust Error Handling & Empty States**
  - Graceful handling of API failures with informative error messages
  - Custom error boundaries to prevent app crashes
  - User-friendly empty state displays when no mentors are found
  - Loading states during data fetching
